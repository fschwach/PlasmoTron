### Create and populate your first plate

So once again it is
```
cd plasmotron
flask run
```

And send your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Note that if you have connected your device to the network you can also access this from a remote computer at http://[server's IP address here]:5000/

Regardless, you should get to

To start off click on *Create new culture plate*. 

Give your plate a name, and specify its geometry.

Press **Create plate** and you will be returned to the home-page where you will see your first cultureplate listed.

<p align="center">

Click on the plate. Here you can see the current cultures on the plate (there aren't any!)

Add one by typing in a name and pressing add.

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/images/step5.png" width=500/></p>

There is our first culture. You can add more. You will notice by default that the cultures are added sequentially going top-to-bottom and then left-to-right. But you can also place a culture wherever you want - just click on a well before pressing *Add culture* and the next culture will be placed in that custom position instead.

So we now have our first plate!

It is probably useful to actually physically set up this plate, it would be prudent to start with just some water (or food colouring) in a plate. Manually the same wells you have indicated with 1ml of liquid.


### Feed your plate

So now we have a physical plate, and a virtual representation of it in the database. We're ready to use the robot to maintain our plate.
