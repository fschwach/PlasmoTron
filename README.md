# PlasmoTron
PlasmoTron is a robotic system built on top of the [OpenTrons](https://opentrons.com/) system, to allow semi-automated culture of malaria parasites.

Specifically PlasmoTron provides these features:
* a database to store information about all plates currently in culture, and where individual cultures are located on them
* a system to control an OpenTrons robot in order to feed these parasites, split them, and/or take an aliquot to measure parasitaemia by SYBR-green flow cytometry
* the ability to upload the results from a flow cytometer to the database and have them associated with each culture at a specific time.
* an intelligent system to use this parasitaemia data to decide how to split parasites
